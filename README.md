# Tic-Tac-Toe React Game

A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React and Vite, featuring local storage to persist game state.

## Features
- Classic Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay
- Persists game state using local storage
- Playable online from any browser

## Live Demo
You can play the game live [here](www.agarciacif.dev/tic-tac-toe/)

## How to Play
1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Two players take turns clicking on the grid to place their mark (X or O).
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
4. If the grid is filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
5. The game state is automatically saved, so you can close the browser and continue later.
